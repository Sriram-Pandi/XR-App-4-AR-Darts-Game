## 📌 Project Summary
**XR App 4 - AR Darts Game** is a **spatially aware AR experience** built using **Meta XR SDK**. The game transforms physical environments into an interactive dart-playing arena, allowing users to **anchor the dartboard**, **throw physics-based darts**, and **score points dynamically**. The experience includes **spatial persistence**, realistic dart mechanics, and an engaging **scoring system**.

## 🔹 Key Features
- **📍 Spatial Anchoring:** Dartboard anchoring persists across sessions, allowing placement anywhere.  
- **🏆 Scoring System:** Tracks **best score**, **current score**, and **time countdown**.  
- **💡 Realistic Dart Physics:** Darts respond to controller velocity for natural throwing mechanics.  
- **🎵 Audio & Haptics:** Includes haptic feedback and sound effects for immersive interactions.  
- **⚙️ Interactive UI:** Start, Restart, and Reset buttons to manage gameplay and scores.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Unity** with **Meta XR SDK**
- **C# scripting** for object interactions and physics
- **Spatial Anchoring** for persistent AR experiences
- **Custom UI elements** for score tracking and game flow

This project showcases **AR-based physics gameplay**, making it a foundation for **augmented reality sports simulations, training applications, and interactive entertainment**. 🚀
